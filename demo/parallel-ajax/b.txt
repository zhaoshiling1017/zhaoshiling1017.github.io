Ice Cave, Slovenia
This Month in Photo of the Day: Your Photos

Ice caves are melting; that's a fact. In an ice cave on the mountain of Stojna near Koƒcevje, Slovenia, the situation has been very dramatic for years. Since 1991 almost four meters of ice have disappeared in the entrance chamber, but at the bottom of the cave emerges a new one. The entrance of this cave faces toward the southeast, which is not common for ice caves. Because of that, the whole area around the entrance is important, and even one cut-down tree can cause huge losses of ice in the cave.

What Makes This a Photo of the Day? The difference between the surface texture of the ice and that of the rocks is nicely defined here, and the climber in the red suit not only provides a sense of scale but also adds interest. —Alexa Keefe, Photo of the Day editor
